# Unicode-Backend-Tasks-Node.js-2021

## Vidhita Pai 
Hey guys! I've tried my best and attempted 3 out of the 4 tasks given to us, and have learned quite a lot about javascript, node.js and databases in the last few weeks. Hoping that I get the opportunity to continue this journey and become a Backend Web Developer with thorough knowledge of the stack I've chosen!

- TASK 1 -
I have used objects to store the words entered, and given attributes to each word, which increments everytime a word is repeated. Then,  have logged the number of distinct words as asked, and also logged the most and least repeated word

- TASK 2 -
I have used express to fetch character data from the Breaking Bad api, and display it in JSON format. Bonus task to display Better Call Saul characters has also been attempted. 

- TASK 3 -
I have attempted to create a database using mongoDB Atlas, connected it to my server, and store my favourite character's information according to all the attributes in the Breaking Bad api in the database, and display that in JSON format.
